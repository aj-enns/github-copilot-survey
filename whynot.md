itle: GitHub Copilot: Quick Check‑In (5 questions, 90 seconds)
Intro text (show at top):
We’re trying to understand what’s blocking folks from giving Copilot a spin. No guilt, no judgement—just honest feedback. Think of this as a bug report for adoption. 🧑‍💻⚙️

The 5 questions (with suggested answer types)
1) What’s the main reason you haven’t used GitHub Copilot yet?
Type: Single‑select (required)
Options:

I haven’t had time (feature freeze on my calendar)
Not sure how/where to start (need a quickstart)
Security/compliance concerns (data, IP, provenance)
Doesn’t fit my stack/tools (editor or language mismatch)
Worried about code quality/hallucinations
Waiting for team approval or guidance
I’m skeptical of AI in my editor (tabs vs. spaces is enough chaos)
Other (free‑text)

2) Which concerns are holding you back the most?
Type: Multi‑select (required)
Options:

Data privacy / enterprise policy
Licensing / cost clarity
Code provenance / reuse rules
“Hallucinations” or wrong suggestions
Performance in large codebases
Editor compatibility (VS Code/JetBrains/SSMS)
Time to learn / setup friction
None of the above—just haven’t bothered yet
Other (free‑text)

3) Where would Copilot help you most (or absolutely not)?
Type: Multi‑select (required)
Options:

Boilerplate & scaffolding (DTOs, CRUD, API wiring)
Tests (unit, integration, “make the mocks not mock me”)
Regex, YAML, and other ancient runes
Infra as Code (Bicep/Terraform), pipelines
SQL/SSMS, data scripts
Pull requests (descriptions, reviews)
“No‑go zone”: I don’t want Copilot touching this part (free‑text)

4) If we offered a 30‑minute setup + quickstart, how likely are you to try Copilot this week?
Type: Likert scale (required)
Scale: Strongly disagree · Disagree · Neutral · Agree · Strongly agree
(Tip: This 5‑point format maps cleanly to sentiment dashboards if you ever want to visualize it—Microsoft uses the same “Strongly disagree → 0 … Strongly agree → 100” normalization for Copilot surveys in their dashboards.

5) What would make you click “Enable” today?
Type: Multi‑select (required)
Options:

A 10‑minute quickstart + recommended settings
Sample repos and prompts relevant to our stack
Team norms/guardrails (what’s OK, what’s not)
Security/Compliance FAQ in plain English
Manager endorsement / expectations
Office hours or a buddy system
Ability to disable Copilot in certain tools (e.g., SSMS)
Success stories from teams like mine

Tone & micro‑copy tips

Keep labels plain; put the jokes in parentheses so options stay scannable.
Add one optional comment field at the end: “Any spicy takes? Keep it constructive.”
Make Q1–Q5 required; keep the final comment optional.

Quick deployment settings (Microsoft Forms)

Anonymous responses on; shuffle options for Q1/Q2/Q5 to reduce bias.
Multi‑select enabled for Q2, Q3, Q5; Likert for Q4.
Add “Other” with free‑text where noted.
Target time: ≤90 seconds (shows completion counts; improves response rate).
